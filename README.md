# Wumpus World AI
My partner and I wrote an AI player that could navigate WumpusWorld.
More Specifically, our code was written in the Python folder in MyAI.py. Played through python shell, our AI was capable of making decisions and playing for itself.
We integrated environmental awareness and our solution to the shortest path problem trying out several methods such as Djikstra's and A* to efficiently navigate different world seeds.

<br /> We participated in a tournament comparing our AI. Out of 167, we placed 20 with a score of 259.052.
