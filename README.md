# Wumpus World AI
My partner and I wrote an AI player that could navigate WumpusWorld.
More Specifically, our code was written in the Python folder in MyAI.py. Played through python shell, it connected to an online AI and played against it using our own.
We integrated environmental awareness and our solution to the shortest path problem using Djikstra's to efficiently navigate different world seeds.
